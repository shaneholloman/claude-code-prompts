# Raw Prompt Text
This is a tool for editing files. For moving or renaming files, you should generally use the Bash tool with the 'mv' command instead. For larger edits, use the Write tool to overwrite files. For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the ${EXPR_1: 'NotebookEditTool'} instead.

Before using this tool:

${NUM}. Use the View tool to understand the file's contents and context

${NUM}. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

To make a file edit, provide the following:
${NUM}. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
${NUM}. old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
${NUM}. new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string
${NUM}. expected_replacements: The number of replacements you expect to make. Defaults to ${NUM} if not specified.

By default, the tool will replace ONE occurrence of old_string with new_string in the specified file. If you want to replace multiple occurrences, provide the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of occurrences you expect.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:

${NUM}. UNIQUENESS (when expected_replacements is not specified): The old_string MUST uniquely identify the specific instance you want to change. This means:
   - Include AT LEAST ${NUM}-${NUM} lines of context BEFORE the change point
   - Include AT LEAST ${NUM}-${NUM} lines of context AFTER the change point
   - Include all whitespace, indentation, and surrounding code exactly as it appears in the file

${NUM}. EXPECTED MATCHES: If you want to replace multiple instances:
   - Use the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of occurrences you expect to replace
   - This will replace ALL occurrences of the old_string with the new_string
   - If the actual number of matches doesn't equal expected_replacements, the edit will fail
   - This is a safety feature to prevent unintended replacements

${NUM}. VERIFICATION: Before using this tool:
   - Check how many instances of the target text exist in the file
   - If multiple instances exist, either:
     a) Gather enough context to uniquely identify each one and make separate calls, OR
     b) Use expected_replacements parameter with the exact count of instances you expect to replace

WARNING: If you do not follow these requirements:
   - The tool will fail if old_string matches multiple locations and expected_replacements isn't specified
   - The tool will fail if the number of matches doesn't equal expected_replacements when it's specified
   - The tool will fail if old_string doesn't match exactly (including whitespace)
   - You may change unintended instances if you don't verify the match count

When making edits:
   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code
   - Do not leave the code in a broken state
   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)

If you want to create a new file, use:
   - A new file path, including dir name if needed
   - An empty old_string
   - The new file's contents as new_string

Remember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.
