## Summary

… — diagnose frozen… Claude Code sessions The user thinks another Claude Code session on this machine is frozen, stuck, or very slow.

# Raw Prompt Text
# ${PATH} — diagnose frozen${PATH} Claude Code sessions

The user thinks another Claude Code session on this machine is frozen, stuck, or very slow. Investigate and post a report to #claude-code-feedback.

## What to look for

Scan for other Claude Code processes (excluding the current one — PID is in `process.pid` but for shell commands just exclude the PID you see running this prompt). Process names are typically `claude` (installed) or `cli` (native dev build).

Signs of a stuck session:
- **High CPU (≥${NUM}%) sustained** — likely an infinite loop. Sample twice, ${NUM}-2s apart, to confirm it's not a transient spike.
- **Process state `D` (uninterruptible sleep)** — often an I/O hang. The `state` column in `ps` output; first character matters (ignore modifiers like `+`, `s`, `<`).
- **Process state `T` (stopped)** — user probably hit Ctrl+Z by accident.
- **Process state `Z` (zombie)** — parent isn't reaping.
- **Very high RSS (≥4GB)** — possible memory leak making the session sluggish.
- **Stuck child process** — a hung `git`, `node`, or shell subprocess can freeze the parent. Check `pgrep -lP <pid>` for each session.

## Investigation steps

${NUM}. **List all Claude Code processes** (macOS${PATH}):
   ```
   ps -axo pid=,pcpu=,rss=,etime=,state=,comm=,command= | grep -E '(claude|cli)' | grep -v grep
   ```
   Filter to rows where `comm` is `claude` or (`cli` AND the command path contains "claude").

${NUM}. **For anything suspicious**, gather more context:
   - Child processes: `pgrep -lP <pid>`
   - If high CPU: sample again after ${NUM}-2s to confirm it's sustained
   - If a child looks hung (e.g., a git command), note its full command line with `ps -p <child_pid> -o command=`
   - Check the session's debug log if you can infer the session ID: `~${PATH}<session-id>.txt` (the last few hundred lines often show what it was doing before hanging)

${NUM}. **Consider a stack dump** for a truly frozen process (advanced, optional):
   - macOS: `sample <pid> ${NUM}` gives a ${NUM}-second native stack sample
   - This is big — only grab it if the process is clearly hung and you want to know *why*

## Report

Post a summary to **#claude-code-feedback** (channel ID: `C07VBSHV7EV`) using the Slack MCP tool. Use ToolSearch to find `slack_send_message` if it's not already loaded.

The report should include:
- Hostname, Claude Code version, how many sessions total, how many look stuck
- For each flagged session: PID, CPU%, RSS, state, uptime, command line, child processes, and your diagnosis of what's likely wrong
- If nothing is flagged, still post a brief all-clear with the session count — the user ran ${PATH} for a reason, so confirming "everything looks fine from the outside" is useful

If Slack MCP isn't available, format the report as a message the user can copy-paste into #claude-code-feedback.

## Notes
- Don't kill or signal any processes — this is diagnostic only.
- Be brief in the Slack message; details can go in a code block.
- If the user gave an argument (e.g., a specific PID or symptom), focus there first.
