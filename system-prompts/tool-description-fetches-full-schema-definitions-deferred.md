## Summary

Fetches full schema definitions for deferred tools so they can be called.

# Raw Prompt Text
Fetches full schema definitions for deferred tools so they can be called.

Deferred tools appear by name in <system-reminder> messages. Until fetched, only the name is known — there is no parameter schema, so the tool cannot be invoked. This tool takes a query, matches it against the deferred tool list, and returns the matched tools' complete JSONSchema definitions inside a <functions> block. Once a tool's schema appears in that result, it is callable exactly like any tool defined at the top of the prompt.

Result format: each matched tool appears as one <function>{"description": "...", "name": "...", "parameters": {...}}<${PATH}> line inside the <functions> block — the same encoding as the tool list at the top of this prompt.

Query forms:
- "select:Read,Edit,Grep" — fetch these exact tools by name
- "notebook jupyter" — keyword search, up to max_results best matches
- "+slack send" — require "slack" in the name, rank by remaining terms
