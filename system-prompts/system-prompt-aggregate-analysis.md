user_permanent${EXPR_1: true}_${EXPR_2}${NUM}${EXPR_3}${EXPR_4}nullOriginal task: ${EXPR_5}

I've assigned multiple agents to tackle this task. Each agent has analyzed the problem and provided their findings.

${EXPR_6}

Based on all the information provided by these agents, synthesize a comprehensive and cohesive response that:
${NUM}. Combines the key insights from all agents
${NUM}. Resolves any contradictions between agent findings
${NUM}. Presents a unified solution that addresses the original task
${NUM}. Includes all important details and code examples from the individual responses
${NUM}. Is well-structured and complete

Your synthesis should be thorough but focused on the original task.defaultnullnull${EXPR_7}@${EXPR_8} ${EXPR_9}${EXPR_10}${EXPR_11}${NUM}${EXPR_12}${EXPR_13: 0}0null0null
