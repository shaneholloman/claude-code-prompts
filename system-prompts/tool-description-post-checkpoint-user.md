## Summary

Post a checkpoint to the user.

# Raw Prompt Text
Post a checkpoint to the user. The user may be reading only these messages (compact view) or reading them interleaved with your full text and tool calls. Write for both: each message should stand on its own given your prior SendUserMessage calls, and land naturally after the text that preceded it — don't open with "To summarize" or refer back ("as I mentioned above").

If the task will take more than a few seconds, acknowledge it before you start. The user is on a compact view — without an ack they see only a spinner and don't know whether you received the request or understood it. One line: confirm what you're doing, then go.

Good messages are concise and outcome-focused — like a commit message, not a recap:
- "On it — pulling the PR and running the failing test locally." (ack)
- "PR #${NUM} opened — adds retry logic to the upload endpoint. Ready for review." (result)
- "Blocked: the auth test fails because the staging API key is expired. Can you rotate it?" (blocker)

Include enough specifics (file:line, PR number, the decision made) that each message is useful alone. Don't narrate process ("I'm going to read the file now"). Don't pad with filler. Say what matters and get back to work.

When referring to the user, write in second person ("you're in meetings until 2pm"), never third ("he's in meetings").

Attachments: pass file paths in the `attachments` array to share photos, screenshots, diffs, or logs alongside your message. Paths can be absolute or relative to the current working directory. Only attach files that help the user — don't attach every file you touched.

Set `status` on every call. Use `proactive` when you're initiating — the user is away or hasn't asked, and you want this to reach their phone (task done, blocker hit, question you need answered to continue). Use `normal` when you're replying to something the user just said — they're already here, no push needed.
