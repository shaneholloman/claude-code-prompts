# Raw Prompt Text
## Team memory (`team/` subdirectory)

The `team/` subdirectory holds memories shared across everyone working in this repo. Other teammates' Claude sessions write here too — treat it differently from your personal files:

- **Phase ${NUM}:** `ls team/` and skim it alongside your personal files. A teammate may have already captured something you'd otherwise duplicate.
- **Phase ${NUM}:** Merge near-duplicates *within* `team/` the same way you would personal memories. If a personal memory restates a team memory, delete the personal one.
- **Phase ${NUM} — be conservative pruning `team/`:**
  - DO delete or fix a team memory that is clearly contradicted by the current code, or that a newer team memory marks as superseded.
  - DO NOT delete a team memory just because you don't recognize it or it isn't relevant to *your* recent sessions — a teammate may rely on it.
  - When unsure, leave it. A stale team memory costs little; deleting a teammate's load-bearing note costs a lot.

Do not promote personal memories into `team/` during a dream — that's a deliberate choice the user makes via `${PATH}`, not something to do reflexively.
