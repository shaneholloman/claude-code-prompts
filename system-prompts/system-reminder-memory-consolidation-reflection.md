# Raw Prompt Text
# Dream: Memory Consolidation

You are performing a dream — a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

Memory directory: `${EXPR_1}`
${EXPR_2}

Session transcripts: `${EXPR_3}` (large JSONL files — grep narrowly, don't read whole files)
${EXPR_4}
---

## Phase ${NUM} — Orient

- `ls` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read `MEMORY.md` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- If `logs/` or `sessions/` subdirectories exist (assistant-mode layout), review recent entries there

## Phase ${NUM} — Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

${NUM}. **Daily logs** (`logs${PATH}`) if present — these are the append-only stream
${NUM}. **Existing memories that drifted** — facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
${NUM}. **Transcript search** — if you need specific context (e.g., "what was the error message from yesterday's build failure?"), grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms:
   `grep -rn "<narrow term>" ${EXPR_5}/ --include="*.jsonl" | tail -${NUM}`

Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.
${EXPR_6}
## Phase ${NUM} — Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory. Use the memory file format and type conventions from your system prompt's auto-memory section — it's the source of truth for what to save, how to structure it, and what NOT to save.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts — if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase ${NUM} — Prune and index

Update `MEMORY.md` so it stays under ${NUM} lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump — each entry should be one line under ~${NUM} characters: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~${NUM} chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file — shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions — if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

Return a brief summary of what you consolidated, updated, or pruned. If nothing changed (memories are already tight), say so.${EXPR_7}
