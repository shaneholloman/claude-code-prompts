# Raw Prompt Text
The user doesn't want to take this action right now. STOP what you are doing and wait for the user to tell you how to proceed.

Note: The user's next message may contain a correction or preference. Pay close attention — if they explain what went wrong or how they'd prefer you to work, consider saving that to memory for future sessions.
