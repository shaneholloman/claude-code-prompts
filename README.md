Unofficial, community-maintained tracking of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) prompt and feature-flag evolution across releases.

## What's Tracked

- `cc-prompt.md` – legacy compatibility file per tag
- `cc-flags.md` – legacy compatibility file per tag
- `system-prompts/*.md` – extracted prompt artifacts grouped by category (see [indeces](indices/))
- `meta/flags.md`, `meta/metadata.md`, `meta/cli-surface.md`, `meta/prompt-stats.md` – derived metadata
- annotated tags (`vX.Y.Z`) and GitHub releases for historical navigation

## How to Read This Repository

1. Pick two tags and open compare view:
   - `https://github.com/marckrenn/claude-code-changelog/compare/v2.1.44...v2.1.45#files_bucket`
2. Use `system-prompts/` for per-file prompt artifacts.
3. Use `meta/` for structured summaries and aggregate metrics.
4. Use `Init` / `Last edit` columns as lifecycle hints for each prompt artifact.
5. For deep full-history research, point a coding agent at this repo directly. GitHub Copilot on github.com is currently limited for broad historical search/analysis.

## Data Quality & Interpretation Notes

- Token totals and per-file counts are estimates.
- Tokenization can vary by model/tokenizer/runtime; small differences are expected.
- Aggregate totals are useful directional signals.
- Estimated LOC is derived from a prettified bundle line count and is only an approximation.
- Prompt files can contain near-duplicates or intentionally duplicated variants.
- File names can change across versions (renames/splits/merges), even when content lineage continues.
- A single conceptual prompt can appear under multiple files in some releases.
- Compare statistical deltas with raw diffs before drawing strong conclusions.

## What Powers [@ClaudeCodeLog](https://x.com/ClaudeCodeLog)

This repo is the backbone of the [@ClaudeCodeLog](https://x.com/ClaudeCodeLog) X account, which automatically:

1. Detects new Claude Code releases
2. Extracts prompts and feature flags
3. Generates structured diff summaries
4. Publishes threaded updates with focused diff links and screenshots
