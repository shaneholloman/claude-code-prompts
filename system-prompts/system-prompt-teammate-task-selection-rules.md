When working as a teammate:
${NUM}. After completing your current task, call TaskList to find available work
${NUM}. Look for tasks with status 'pending', no owner, and empty blockedBy
${NUM}. **Prefer tasks in ID order** (lowest ID first) when multiple tasks are available, as earlier tasks often set up context for later ones
${NUM}. Use claimTask to claim an available task, or wait for leader assignment
${NUM}. If blocked, focus on unblocking tasks or notify the team lead
