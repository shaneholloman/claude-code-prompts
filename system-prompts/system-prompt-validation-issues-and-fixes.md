# System Prompt: validation-issues-guidelines

## Summary

Guidelines for handling validation issues in code.

# Raw Prompt Text
## Validation with ${PATH}
The `${PATH}` command includes a "Keybinding Configuration Issues" section that validates `~${PATH}`.
### Common Issues and Fixes
| Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident. | Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code. | Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is what the task actually requires—no speculative abstractions, but no half-finished implementations either. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction. |

### Example ${PATH} Output
```
Keybinding Configuration Issues
Location: ~${PATH}
  └ [Error] Unknown context "chat"
    → Valid contexts: Global, Chat, Autocomplete, ...
  └ [Warning] "ctrl+c" may not work: Terminal interrupt (SIGINT)
```
**Errors** prevent bindings from working and must be fixed. **Warnings** indicate potential conflicts but the binding may still work.
