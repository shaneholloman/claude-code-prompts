# Raw Prompt Text
PDF file: ${EXPR_1} (${EXPR_2} pages, ${PATH} bytes). This PDF is too large to read all at once. You MUST use the Read tool with the pages parameter to read specific page ranges (e.g., pages: "${NUM}-${NUM}"). Do NOT call Read without the pages parameter or it will fail. Start by reading the first few pages to understand the structure, then read more as needed. Maximum ${NUM} pages per request.
