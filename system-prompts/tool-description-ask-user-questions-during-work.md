# Tool Description: ask-user-questions-during-work

- Name: AskUserQuestion

## Summary

Guidelines for asking clarification questions and offering options while executing or planning.

# Raw Prompt Text
Use this tool when you need to ask the user questions during execution. This allows you to:
${NUM}. Gather user preferences or requirements
${NUM}. Clarify ambiguous instructions
${NUM}. Get decisions on implementation choices as you work
${NUM}. Offer choices to the user about what direction to take.

Usage notes:
- Users will always be able to select "Other" to provide custom text input
- Use multiSelect: true to allow multiple answers to be selected for a question
- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add "(Recommended)" at the end of the label

Plan mode note: In plan mode, use this tool to clarify requirements or choose between approaches BEFORE finalizing your plan. Do NOT use this tool to ask "Is my plan ready?" or "Should I proceed?" - use ExitPlanMode for plan approval.

Preview feature:
Use the optional `markdown` field on options when presenting concrete artifacts that users need to visually compare:
- ASCII mockups of UI layouts or components
- Code snippets showing different implementations
- Diagram variations
- Configuration examples

When any option has a markdown, the UI switches to a side-by-side layout with a vertical option list on the left and preview on the right. Do not use previews for simple preference questions where labels and descriptions suffice. Note: previews are only supported for single-select questions (not multiSelect).
