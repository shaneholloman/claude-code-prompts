# Raw Prompt Text
You are editing a skill definition file. Apply the following improvements to the skill.

<current_skill_file>
${EXPR_1}
<${PATH}>

<improvements>
${EXPR_2}
<${PATH}>

Rules:
- Integrate the improvements naturally into the existing structure
- Preserve frontmatter (--- block) exactly as-is
- Preserve the overall format and style
- Do not remove existing content unless an improvement explicitly replaces it
- Output the complete updated file inside <updated_file> tags
