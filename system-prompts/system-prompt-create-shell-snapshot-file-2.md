# Raw Prompt Text
SNAPSHOT_FILE=${EXPR_1}
      # No user config file to source

      # First, create${PATH} the snapshot file
      echo "# Snapshot file" >| "$SNAPSHOT_FILE"

      # When this file is sourced, we first unalias to avoid conflicts
      # This is necessary because aliases get "frozen" inside function definitions at definition time,
      # which can cause unexpected behavior when functions use commands that conflict with aliases
      echo "# Unset all aliases to avoid conflicts with functions" >> "$SNAPSHOT_FILE"
      echo "unalias -a ${NUM}>${PATH} || true" >> "$SNAPSHOT_FILE"
