# Raw Prompt Text
Executes a given PowerShell command with optional timeout. Working directory persists between commands; shell state (variables, functions) does not.

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations via PowerShell: git, npm, docker, and PS cmdlets. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

${EXPR_1}

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

${EXPR_2}. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `Get-ChildItem` (or `ls`) to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

${EXPR_3}. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes
   - Capture the output of the command.

PowerShell Syntax Notes:
   - Variables use $ prefix: $myVar = "value"
   - Escape character is backtick (`), not backslash
   - Use Verb-Noun cmdlet naming: Get-ChildItem, Set-Location, New-Item, Remove-Item
   - Common aliases: ls (Get-ChildItem), cd (Set-Location), cat (Get-Content), rm (Remove-Item)
   - Pipe operator | works similarly to bash but passes objects, not text
   - Use Select-Object, Where-Object, ForEach-Object for filtering and transformation
   - String interpolation: "Hello $name" or "Hello $($obj.Property)"
   - Registry access uses PSDrive prefixes: `HKL${EXPR_4} `HKC${EXPR_5} — NOT raw `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\...`
   - Environment variables: read with `$env:NAME`, set with `$env:NAME = "value"` (NOT `Set-Variable` or bash `export`)
   - Call native exe with spaces in path via call operator: `& "${EXPR_6} Files\App\app.exe" arg1 arg2`

Interactive and blocking commands (will hang — this tool runs with -NonInteractive):
   - NEVER use `Read-Host`, `Get-Credential`, `Out-GridView`, `$Host.UI.PromptForChoice`, or `pause`
   - Destructive cmdlets (`Remove-Item`, `Stop-Process`, `Clear-Content`, etc.) may prompt for confirmation. Add `-Confirm:$false` when you intend the action to proceed. Use `-Force` for read-only${EXPR_7} items.
   - Never use `git rebase -i`, `git add -i`, or other commands that open an interactive editor

Passing multiline strings (commit messages, file content) to native executables:
   - Use a single-quoted here-string so PowerShell does not expand `$` or backticks inside. The closing `'@` MUST be at column ${EXPR_8} (no leading whitespace) on its own line — indenting it is a parse error:
<example>
git commit -m @'
Commit message here.
Second line with $literal dollar signs.
'@
<${EXPR_9}>
   - Use `@'...'@` (single-quoted, literal) not `@"..."@` (double-quoted, interpolated) unless you need variable expansion
   - For arguments containing `-`, `@`, or other characters PowerShell parses as operators, use the stop-parsing token: `git log --% --format=%H`

Usage notes:
  - The command argument is required.
  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to ${EXPR_10}ms / ${EXPR_11} minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after ${EXPR_12}ms (${EXPR_13} minutes).
  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does.
  - If the output exceeds ${EXPR_14} characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.
${EXPR_15}  - Avoid using PowerShell to run commands that have dedicated tools, unless explicitly instructed:
    - File search: Use ${EXPR_16} (NOT Get-ChildItem -Recurse)
    - Content search: Use ${EXPR_17} (NOT Select-String)
    - Read files: Use ${EXPR_18} (NOT Get-Content)
    - Edit files: Use ${EXPR_19}
    - Write files: Use ${EXPR_20} (NOT Set-Content${EXPR_21})
    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT Write-Output${EXPR_22})
  - When issuing multiple commands:
    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple ${EXPR_23} tool calls in a single message.
    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, chain them in a single ${EXPR_24} call (see edition-specific chaining syntax above).
    - Use `;` only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.
    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings and here-strings)
  - Do NOT prefix commands with `cd` or `Set-Location` -- the working directory is already set to the correct project directory automatically.
${EXPR_25}  - For git commands:
    - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.
    - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal. Only use destructive operations when they are truly the best approach.
    - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign, -c commit.gpgsign=false) unless the user has explicitly asked for it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.
