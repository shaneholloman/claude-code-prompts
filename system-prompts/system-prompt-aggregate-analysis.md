${EXPR_1: false}_${EXPR_2}${NUM}${EXPR_3}${EXPR_4}${EXPR_5}nullOriginal task: ${EXPR_6}

I've assigned multiple agents to tackle this task. Each agent has analyzed the problem and provided their findings.

${EXPR_7}

Based on all the information provided by these agents, synthesize a comprehensive and cohesive response that:
${NUM}. Combines the key insights from all agents
${NUM}. Resolves any contradictions between agent findings
${NUM}. Presents a unified solution that addresses the original task
${NUM}. Includes all important details and code examples from the individual responses
${NUM}. Is well-structured and complete

Your synthesis should be thorough but focused on the original task.defaultnullnull${EXPR_8}@${EXPR_9} ${EXPR_10}${EXPR_11}${EXPR_12}${NUM}${EXPR_13}${EXPR_14: 0}0null0null
